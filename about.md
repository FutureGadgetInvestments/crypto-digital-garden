## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of research and notes that are:

- **Non-linear**: Research links to other research rather than being organized chronologically
- **Evolving**: Content is updated and refined as new information emerges
- **Imperfect**: Not everything needs to be polished - rough ideas and early findings are welcome
- **Connected**: Ideas build on each other through bidirectional links

## Disclaimer

This research is for educational and informational purposes only. Nothing here constitutes financial advice. Always do your own research before making investment decisions.
