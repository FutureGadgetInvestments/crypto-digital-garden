Welcome to my crypto investment research garden.

This is a collection of research, analysis, and insights on crypto investment ventures I'm exploring. Unlike a blog with polished posts, this digital garden is a space for learning in public, where ideas can grow and evolve as I dive deeper into each topic.

## Research Categories

- **Perp DEX Liquidity Pools** - Research on perpetual DEX LP strategies and yield opportunities
- **Stable Coins** - Analysis of stablecoin mechanisms, risks, and yield strategies
- **Zero Coupon Bonds** - Exploration of DeFi fixed income and zero coupon bond protocols

## How to Navigate

- **Research** is organized by category and linked together
- Look for **Linked References** at the bottom of research pages to discover connections
- Research has growth stages:
  - **Seedling**: New, rough ideas and initial findings
  - **Budding**: Developing analysis and research
  - **Evergreen**: Well-developed, comprehensive research

Feel free to explore and follow the links that interest you.
